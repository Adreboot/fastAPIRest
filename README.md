# User Management System with FastAPI

## Project Description

In this project, weâ€™ll create a user management system using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy as the object-relational mapping (ORM) to handle database operations.

The user management system will provide a comprehensive set of API endpoints to allow users to perform everyday tasks such as adding a new user, updating user information, fetching user details, and deleting user accounts.

The user management system will be integrated with a DBMS to allow for seamless storage and retrieval of user data. SQLAlchemy will manage database operations, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and deleting records, and querying the database.
